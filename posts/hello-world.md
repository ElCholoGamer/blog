Alright, let's see what we got here.

**Bold text**? Check.
_Italics_? Check.
Do `code snippets` work? Yep, they do.

```ts
function isEven(num: number): boolean {
	return num % 2 === 0;
}
```

Nice, code blocks work too. That's important.

Oh, hello there! I was just testing out my new blog. Well, it's not actually done at the time I'm writing this. Gonna use this as a test as soon as I get it working.

If you're interested, you can go read more [about me](/about), or maybe take a look at the [posts](/posts) I've made.

Also, why not check out my [main website](https://elchologamer.me)?
